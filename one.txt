see folder one file 1 before that 
this is to upload filr from local to gitHub server 


----- git status 
----- git init 
----- git add .
----- git commit -m "message"
----- git log -oneline 

///   now to push that 
git remote -v
git remote add origin https url 
git push origin main
better to write to u so that when next time we want to push we can just do that with ---(git push)
--- git push -u origin main



Again id edit is done then 
git add file name 
git commit -m "message"
git push 

Done
